           We maintain a membership of 180 families strong. Although we are currently at our maximum,
           we maintain a waiting list of families who are interested in joining the club.
           We are typically able to accomodate a number of new families each year through normal attrition.
           If you are interested in a JLSC membership or information please see the <a href="contact.htlm">Contact Us</a>  page.
        </p>
        <p>We are located on Juniper Lane in Bridgewater Township, just off Country Club Rd about 1 mile north of Garretson Rd.</p>
