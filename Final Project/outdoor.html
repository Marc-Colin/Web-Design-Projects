		<h2>Places to Rock Climb Outdoors in New Jersey</h2>
		<dl>
			<dt>Allamuchy State Park</dt>
				<dd>
				Easily the most "developed" climbing area in the state, Allamuchy has
				been popular with local underground craggers for years. Now that it's legal to climb there,
				climbers can enjoy the park's bouldering sites and even some longer wall climbs
				on Allamuchy Mountain with a drive-up-and-climb kind of convenience that you won't
				find elsewhere in the state. Enter off of Stephen's State Park Road in Warren County.
				</dd>
			<dt>Wawayanda State Park</dt>
				<dd>
				The most remote park in the New Jersey state park system is also home
				to some surprisingly good climbing. Since the waiver policy was put
				in place, climbers have begun to explore Wawayanda's backcountry crags
				and hidden rock faces. The park is a good 3-1/2 hours from southern New Jersey,
				most of the climbs require difficult hike-ins, and set routes are currently non-existent,
				but the area's climbing potential is huge. Located in the northern part of the
				state in Sussex County, take the Warwick Turnpike from West Milford.
				</dd>
			<dt>Green Pond</dt>
				<dd>
				Overlooking the swampy, overgrown Green Pond outside of Butler,
				NJ is "some of the best climbing in the state." Aside from a few
				scattered boulders, Green Pond offers a 150-plus foot vertical wall
				that stretches some 200 yards end to end. Access can be tough -
				it takes about 20 minutes to hike in from the road, plus the talus field
				- but the payoff is a virtually unclimbed wall and non-existent crowds.
				Not all of it is pretty, but it's a chance to get creative and create your
				own routes. Butler is in Morris County, and access is easiest via 287 to Route 23.
				Green Pond is not for the inexperienced. Green Pond is remote.
				Hiking and parking permits are available voa the Newark Watershed Office off Echo Lake Road.
				</dd>
			<dt>Delaware Water Gap</dt>
				<dd>
				Situated near the border of New Jersey and Pennsylvania,
				the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area is best known
				for its paddling and backcountry hiking, but the areas is becoming
				more popular with climbers as well. Several area climbing schools
				offer classes at the Water Gap, and a number of routes have gone up
				on the New Jersey side in recent years. From the east, take NJ
				Interstate 80 to Exit 34 and go 25 miles west to the town of Layton, NJ.
				Climbing at the Gap is not for the faint-hearted. Weather changes,
				exposure, aproach trails and other issues will impact your climbing.
				Follow National Park Service rules and regulations.
				</dd>
			<dt>Somerset County boulders</dt>
				<dd>
				Local, convenient, and plentiful, the bouldering areas in central New Jersey's
				Sourland Mountain Preserve were recently approved for climbing by the Somerset
				County Park Commission. The hills in this area are renowned for their boulder
				climbing, and now that it's legal to climb in Somerset County the local climbing
				scene is starting to venture out of the gyms. Remember though, several neighboring
				counties and landowners still prohibit access. Take 287 west to Hillsborough and
				enter via East Mountain Road.
